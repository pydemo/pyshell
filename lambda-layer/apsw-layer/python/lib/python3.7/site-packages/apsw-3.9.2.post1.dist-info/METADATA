A Python wrapper for the SQLite embedded relational database engine.
In contrast to other wrappers such as pysqlite it focuses on being
a minimal layer over SQLite attempting just to translate the
complete SQLite API into Python.

This packge is provided by a third party and NOT the original package
creater. It bundles sqlite 3 (via `python setup.py fetch --sqlite`) so
the packge can be cleanly installed. *PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW THE INSTALL
INSTRUCTIONS FOR APSW TO BE SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR YOU!*
